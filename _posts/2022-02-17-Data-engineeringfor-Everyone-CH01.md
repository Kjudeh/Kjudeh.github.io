##  This is how data flows in an organization: 
Data engineers: 
1. Data collection & storage                       
Data scientists:
2. Data preperation
3. Exploration & visualization
4. Experimentation & prediction 

## A data engineer's responsibilities: 

1. Ingest data from different resources
2. Omptimize databses for analysis
3. Remove corrupted data
4. Develop, constryuct, test and maintain data architectures

## The five Vs
1. Volume (homw much?)
2. Variety (what kind?)
3. Velocity (how frequent?)
4. Veracity (how accurate?)
5. Value (how useful?)

## Data Pipline:

When you have multiple data inputs from multiple data resources to one data link, the resources are considered piplines. This then is converted to databases, also considered as piplines. 
Imaging a pipe that is also a line. that's a pipeline. Data engineers create piplines for data scientists to play with. 

Data piplines insure that data flows efficiently

ETL: 

1. extracting the data
2. Transform the exctracted data
3. Load transformed data to another database

# In summary: 
1. Move data from one system to another
2. May follow ETL
3. Data may not be transformed
4. Data may be directly loaded in applications
