Panda is used to manipulate data that come in a form of tables.   
pd.dataFrame() builds a table from dictionary  
pd.read_csv('') reads a file from directory  

multiple indexing mnethods for pandas  
1. square brackets: use double square brackets to keep it as a dataframe, you can use the label instead of slicing
    * column access cars[["name", "model"]]
    * row access cars [1:4 ]
2. advanced indexing (loc & iloc): 
* loc (label - based)  
row access cars.loc [["ru", "in", "ch"]]  
column access cars.loc[:, ["country" : "capital"]]  

row and column access:   

cars.loc[
    ["ru", "in", "ch"],
    ["country", "capital"]
        ]  

* iloc (position - based)  

1 row: cars.iloc [[1 ]]   
multiple rows: cars.iloc[[1,2,3 ]]   
all rows, specific columns [:, [1,2,3 ]]
